	description "The Heat Redistribution Ray is the Kaltheim's primary cooling method; by using some very complicated physics, they are able to trap superhot particles within a beam, which can then be fired at an enemy ship. The excess heat required for this weapon is sourced from the other outfits installed on a ship, providing the cooling effect."
	description "	This weapon is entirely unhindered by shields, instead piercing through to transmit heat directly to the enemy ship's hull. As a result of the increased heat upon it, this often causes the hull to begin to warp, causing a small amount of damage."

	description "The Phase Missile is a terrifying weapon designed by the Kaltheim to warp in and out of this plane of existence as it flies, allowing it to dodge anti-missile systems entirely. However, this universe-swap technology severely limits the projectile's range."

	description "Kaltheim ships have frequently had problems with preventing enemy ships from jumping into hyperspace; while Phase Missiles are somewhat effective, they are also rather expensive and can be foiled by anti-missile systems."
	description "	As a result, the Engine Destabiliser was built, designed to mess with the output of the target's engines, making their main thrusters and steering ineffective for a time."
	description "	The Destabiliser also has the side effect of the target ship being thrown off into space once the weapon's effects begin to recede."

	description "To combat humanity's penchant for throwing thousands of missiles at enemy ships, the Kaltheim have unearthed an old anti-missile design, from the days before their species was united and weapons more primitive than the Phase Missile were still in use."
	description "	As with many other Kaltheim systems, the Hyperborean anti-missile system is capable of draining excess heat from the ship it is mounted on whenever it fires."

	
# Shields:

	"shield generation" 1.3
	"shield energy" 1.3
	description "The Tundra-Class Shield Generator is the smallest Kaltheim shield system. Designed to absorb energy from the projectiles which it deflects, this allows smaller Kaltheim ships to operate only on relatively small generators. The dissipation effects used by Kaltheim shields also allow them to cool their ships when being fired on."

	"shield generation" 2.8
	"shield energy" 2.8
	description "The Glacial-Class Shield Generator is the next step up in Kaltheim shielding technology. It employs better cooling, energy absorption and shield generation than Tundra shields in order to provide a more efficient shielding system for larger Kaltheim ships."

	description "The Floe reactor is the Kaltheim's primary power source for their smaller ships. As with almost all Kaltheim outfits, it cools the ship it is installed on in addition to generating power."
