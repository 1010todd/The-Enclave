	description "The Heat Redistribution Ray is the Kaltheim's primary cooling method; by using some very complicated physics, they are able to trap superhot particles within a beam, which can then be fired at an enemy ship. The excess heat required for this weapon is sourced from the other outfits installed on a ship, providing the cooling effect."
	description "	This weapon is entirely unhindered by shields, instead piercing through to transmit heat directly to the enemy ship's hull. As a result of the increased heat upon it, this often causes the hull to begin to warp, causing a small amount of damage."
