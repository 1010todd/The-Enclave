			`You find a good few thousand soldiers, captains, officers and engineers gathered at the spaceport, looking industrious as they work on ships of all sizes, from Penguins, to Apollos, to Destroyer-sized warships that you haven't seen before.`
			choice
				`	Go and find someone for orders.`
			`	After some searching, you discover Admiral Kuznetsov overseeing repairs to an extremely heavily modified Destroyer- presumably his flagship.`
			`	"Go get your ship repaired," Kuznetsov snaps without looking at you. "We're off to retake Seminar in the morning, the aliens took it whilst we were in transit from Perihelion. You're in charge of four Destroyers." He waves over his shoulder to a group of bashed-up looking ships.`
			choice
				`	Go meet the crew of your squadron.`
					goto 1
				`	"What about XSZ? Shouldn't we be fighting them too?"`
					goto 4
				`	"Why not head for New Scotland instead?"`				
			`	The Admiral turns to look at you. "Tell me, why should we head for New Scotland?"`
			choice
				`	"Its people deserve to be liberated!"`
					goto 3
				`	"It makes more sense; it gives us a clear path to Seminar."`
					goto 2
				`	"I want more fights."`
			`	Kuznetsov spits on the ground. "Idiots like you are who'll lose us this war," he says angrily, glaring at you from under his 18th-century admiral's hat. "We need to pick our battles, minimise our losses. New Scotland isn't worth that much to us yet."`
				goto 1
			label 2
			`	"Good point," Kuznetsov replies. "But it's immediately next to one of the alien systems, so as soon as we took it they'd launch an assault to retake it. But retaking Seminar puts them in a weaker position, and from there we can strike back at New Scotland with the rest of the southern arm behind us."`
				goto 1
			label 3
			`	Kuznetsov looks at you with a dirty look in his eyes. "They're only farmers," he says disdainfully. "Not worth liberating them except if we wanted to make a political point. Which we don't."`
				goto 1
			label 1
			`	You thank the Admiral and head over to your squadron to learn their names. It's going to be a tough battle...`
				accept

			`	"They aren't a priority now," Kuznetsov replies. "We can deal with them later."`
