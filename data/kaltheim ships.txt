	description "The Lenmig'sraor 52-T is a somewhat antiquated Kaltheim design, from the days before they began ramping up for the invasion. The original versions were equipped with a number of fighter bays, but in the run-up to war many were heavily modified to become hunter-killers, sacrificing the fighters in favour of more maneuverability as well as more gun slots and turrets."
	description "	While the old versions of the ship are rarely seen nowadays, when they are deemed suitable for a battle they are a major force on the battlefield."
