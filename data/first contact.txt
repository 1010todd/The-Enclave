			`The landing pad is deserted as your ship touches down, yet as you walk out into this world in a new galaxy, surprisingly, a group of humans exit the main spaceport building and begin walking towards you.`

			`	"Our ancestors were brought here from, we believe, the Deep, during the Alpha Wars," Rosalva replies. "Apparently it was some way of spreading out humanity so that a conflict, potentially with any larger group of Alphas, couldn't completely wipe our species out. Anyway, it's good to see that the Pug have finally reopened the wormhole back home."`

			`	Rosalva, and some of the other officials with her look surprised. "They aren't common knowledge in the Milky Way?"`
			choice
				`	"They are, but we only just met them- they invaded human space and took over a group of systems south of Earth."`
				`	"Well, they are, but we're completely opposed to them, considering that they just invaded human space without any provocation."`
			`	Shock briefly passes over Rosalva's face, and she gives you an odd look. "They've never been anything but benevolent towards us," she replies, clearly skeptical.`
			`	You shrug. "Not what we've seen," you say.`
