	description "The Apollo is the largest and most advanced warship developed by the Enclave so far, somewhere between the Cruisers and the Carriers of the Republic in terms of size. The Apollo is able to carry two fighters in its bays, usually Darts. Despite its size, the Apollo is fairly maneuverable, capable of matching many interceptors in combat."
	description "	The Apollo was named after the series of missions during the second half of the 20th century which allowed humanity to set foot on a stellar object other than Earth for the first time."

	description "The Bloodhound is a lean, mean fighting vessel recently produced by XSZ Shipyards. Equipped with slightly outdated weaponry, for Enclave space at least, the Bloodhound makes up for the lack of high-end weapons through its impressive speed, handling like an interceptor as it dominates the battlefield."
	description "	As a result of the massive energy production systems on board, the Bloodhound is currently one of the most expensive ships available in this galaxy."

	description "This was one of the first ships developed by XSZ after the company's inception. Not much more than the traditional freighters found back in the Republic, this ship is a slice of home oddly out of place in this galaxy."
	description "	Oddly enough, this ship's name came about due to a data corruption. Originally referred to by XSZ developers as The Freighter, when XSZ's servers were hacked, the schematic's name was changed to `The Fregter`- and it stuck."

	description "The Dart is an efficient fighter, developed by the Enclave's government shipyards to replace the aging Lance as their primary fighter. Equipped with a slightly more comprehensive set of outfits than the Lance, a Dart piloted by a skilled captain has potential to survive many a battle."

	description "The Buzzard is a light warship designed by the XSZ Corporation to be able to carry two of their heavy particle cannons. As a result, this ship has very little outfit space free, and has been designed to use the most efficient setup possible in order to extract the most value from the HFS-8B1."
